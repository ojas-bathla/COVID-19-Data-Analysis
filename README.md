# COVID-19-Data-Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project combines **Python-based exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to visualize COVID-19 trends in India.  
It highlights skills in **data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and dashboard design**, with applications in **data analytics, public health monitoring, and bioinformatics research**.

The analysis focuses on:
- Tracking COVID-19 spread & vaccination progress
- Identifying top affected states
- Creating KPIs for quick insights
- Visualizing trends and geospatial distribution

---

## ðŸ“‚ Data Sources
Publicly available datasets containing:
- State-wise COVID-19 case counts
- Vaccination data by age group and state

Data was processed in Python and exported to CSV for use in Power BI.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Power BI**: DAX measures, interactive visuals, map charts, and custom formatting
- **GitHub**: Version control and documentation

## ðŸ“Š Python Analysis
Performed in Jupyter Notebook:
1. **Data Cleaning** â€“ Handled null values, corrected data types
2. **EDA** â€“ Used Pandas and Seaborn to explore trends
3. **Key Outputs**:
   - `max_vac.csv`: Top vaccinated states
   - `top_10_active.csv`: Top states by active cases
   - `top_10_deaths.csv`: States with highest deaths
   - `statewise.csv`: State-level summary
   - `vaccine.csv` & `vaccination.csv`: Vaccination details
4. Exported clean datasets to CSV for dashboard building
